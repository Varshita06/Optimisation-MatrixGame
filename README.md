# Optimisation-MatrixGame

Simulating and finding the optimal strategy for a game described as follows -  
given a payoff matrix, two players play with given stochastic vectors which decide the probablities of coosing a certain row/ column on a certain move.  
The corresponding matrix element represents how much one player must pay to the other.  
The goal for any one player is to earn the most number of points possible / minimise losses.
